# Authenticator

Authenticators are an additional layer of security. A client must pass the authenticator in order to communicate with the game server.

Authenticator logic can be fully customized by inheriting from the _**Authenticator**_ script, and placing your created authenticator within the [Server Manager component](/docs/manual/guides/components/managers/server-manager).
