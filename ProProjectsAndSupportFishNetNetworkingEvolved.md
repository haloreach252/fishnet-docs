# Pro, Projects, and Support

Learn how to access a variety of enhancements for your Fish-Networking experience. We aim to provide reasonable pricing ranging from smaller indie developers to large studios.

## 


Purchasing

There are a variety of ways to purchase Pro and Projects.

At this time Projects are ONLY available through purchase on GitHub (preferred) or Patreon. Projects will be submitted to the asset store soon.

Pro can be bought from the asset store, as well through GitHub or Patreon.

When buying through the asset store you are gaining lifetime updates to only what you purchased. For example: if you purchased Fish-Networking Pro on the asset store, this does not automatically provide you with Projects.

When obtaining Pro through GitHub (preferred) or Patreon you will have access to both Pro and Projects.

There are several ways to purchase depending on what you are interested in.

You can make a one-time payment of $10, and $1/month for updates.

Lifetime updates to both Pro and Projects can be obtained by making a one-time payment of $60. This option offers extra perks.

You may also gain lifetime updates by contributing $60 over time.

Lifetime updates to projects only is also available after contributing $35.

[Support tiers](/docs/master/pro-projects-and-support#support-tier-options) are offered exclusively through GitHub.

**This also includes business support tiers.**

While a supporter on any tier you have access to claim a Discord _FirstGearGames Supporter_ role to show off your support for the project; Priority Support tiers provide additional roles.

After unlocking projects you may immediately downgrade to the Updates Only tier to receive project updates at a much lower monthly cost.

Do not forget to claim your role on our Discord server!

Pro

Some features are only available in Fish-Networking Pro.

All business [support tiers](/docs/master/pro-projects-and-support#support-tier-options) also grant a complimentary lifetime Pro license.

We have an extremely flexible sharing license for Fish-Networking Pro, allowing teams and classrooms to work on a single purchase. You can view that license [here](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

#### 


Features For Pro:

> **Lag Compensation**
> 
> Another very important feature for precision based gaming is lag compensation. This is the act of rolling back colliders in time to where a client had seen them; this ensures accurate hit registration. This technique is applicable to several genre types but is most commonly seen in shooter games

> **Automatic Code Stripping**
> 
> Code stripping helps protect your game server by removing sensitive logic that the player should not be aware of. Far as we know, Fish-Networking is the only solution with the ability to remove server code from clients, and client code from the server.

> **Network Level of Detail**
> 
> Level of Detail determines how often the server sends updates to clients. With level of detail enabled moving objects can expect to use up to 95% LESS bandwidth. Other aspects of Fish-Networking benefit marginally from network level of detail as well.

> **Extrapolation, NetworkTransform**
> 
> When enabled the NetworkTransform will extrapolate as necessary to create a smoother experience for unstable connections.

> **Synchronized Parameters, NetworkAnimator**
> 
> Customize which parameters are synchronized over the network on the NetworkAnimator.

> **Yak**
> 
> [Yak](/docs/manual/guides/components/transports/yak-pro-feature) is a transport which provides an entirely offline experience using your multiplayer code. When combined with Multipass (available to free users), you may run your game offline or online.

## 


Projects

Projects are completed Unity projects which act as a template or learning opportunity.

> **Lobby and Worlds**
> 
> Lobby and Worlds is designed to use a single server for a lobby containing your players, as well create games on the same server using rooms created by your players. Each room is isolated from other players, both visually and in network traffic.
> 
> Many aspects of the lobby can be customized to your needs. Lobby and Worlds allows you to design your game normally in it's own scenes, while the project takes care of everything else.
> 
> Features include:
> 
> *   Loading any number of game scenes, multiple times; think dungeon instances!
>     
> *   Sign in system.
>     
> *   Lobby to create and join rooms.
>     
> *   Join rooms after start, optional.
>     
> *   Password rooms.
>     
> *   Ready up system, optional.
>     
> *   Kick players.
>     
> *   Player limits.
>     
> *   Customizable lobby logic and demo game.
